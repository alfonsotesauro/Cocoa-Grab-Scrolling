# Cocoa-Grab-Scrolling

This project was developed by Matt Gemmel :

It Shows how to implement grab-scrolling in cocoa, like in Preview, Photoshop, Acrobat and more.
Includes the two requisite hand-cursors.

I just refactored it in a Xcode 6 project. I have also created a webpage for the project, for any future improvement.
